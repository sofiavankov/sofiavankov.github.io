                <p>You quickly type in the code and remove the handcuffs from your friend’s hands. Everyone is super
                    confused. “I just found them here and wanted to see how they work”. Yep. She was drunk. Very drunk.
                    But hey! At least you found her, and it’s finally time for the party! You put your hands in your
                    pocket to reach for your keys, or maybe let me correct that, your dad’s keys!
                    <br>
                    Which one is the correct car key?
                    <br>
                    That is a very good question! All I can say is, there are more types of keys that you can think of!
                    You only have one car key, there is no need for more!
